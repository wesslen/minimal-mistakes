As part of my RA role for UNCC's [Data Science Initative](http://dsi.uncc.edu) and [Project Mosaic](http://projectmosaic.uncc.edu), I'm tasked with providing Twitter data resources for acquisition, preparation and analysis for UNCC researchers. 

These resources include Gnip's [Historical PowerTrack API](http://support.gnip.com/apis/historical_api/) and DSI's [SOPHI platform](http://sophi.uncc.edu).

As an introduction, I've created [this FAQ page](http://webpages.uncc.edu/rwesslen/blogs/twitter-faq.html) to aid researchers who are interested in leveraging these resources and/or learning ways to analyze Twitter data. 

Moving forward, I'll use this blog for more posts about resources for Twitter (and other social media platforms).
