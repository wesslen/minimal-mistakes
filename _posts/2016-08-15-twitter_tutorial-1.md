If you're new to Twitter analytics, [here's a link](http://webpages.uncc.edu/rwesslen/blogs/01-beerandtweeting.html) to a tutorial on analyzing Twitter data from Gnip using R.

The example uses a dataset of beer-related Tweets from Charlotte, NC between Dec 2015 - Feb 2016. The Tweets were identified using beer-related keywords (e.g. beer, ale, ipa, names of breweries/bars). The original dataset was based on geo-located Tweets in a bounding box around Charlotte; therefore, the dataset does not include non-geolocated Tweets.
