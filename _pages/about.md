I'm a PhD candidate in Computing and Information Systems at UNC Charlotte, with research affiliations with UNC Charlotte's [Charlotte Visualization Center](http://viscenter.uncc.edu/), [Data Science Initiative](http://dsi.uncc.edu), [Project Mosaic](http://projectmosaic.uncc.edu), and the [Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/).

My focus is on integrating computer science methods with social science research: the emerging field of computational social science. My research interests include text analysis, visual analytics, and social media applications.
