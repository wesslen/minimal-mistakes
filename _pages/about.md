Every day you leave a trail of data when you comment on your friend's Facebook photo, send an email or retweet a funny cat photo. As our lives become more integrated with digital platforms, we leave more and more digital footprints tracing our thoughts, feelings, opinions and actions.

In this blog, I will cover tools and techniques to analyze the abundant troves of digital footprints in social media, text and social networks. 

I'm a PhD student in Computing and Information Systems at UNC Charlotte. I have a dual research assistantship through UNC Charlotte's [Data Science Initiative](http://dsi.uncc.edu) and [Project Mosaic](http://projectmosaic.uncc.edu), the university's social science research initiative. 

My focus is on integrating computer science methods with social science research: the emerging field of computational social science. My research interests include social network analysis, text analysis, visualizations and social media applications.
